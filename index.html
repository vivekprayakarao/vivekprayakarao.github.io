      <h3>1. SLAM backend for cloud based mapping</h3>
      <p>Real-time mapping is still a challenge for a lot of mobile robots, as available computation power is very limited and also to avoid network overflow from rgbd data, it is necessary to rethink algorithms. In this project, a keyframe-graph based map is created and a metric distance based loop closure detection is applied. Further, the constructed graph is is optimized using g2o on regualar intervals to minimize the error cost. This is implemented in ROS using pcl, opencv and g2o. It is further fine tuned to perform on multi-core cpu.</p>

			<h3>2. 3D Mapping of Indoor Environments</h3>
			During Master Course, I played around a lot with RGBD sensors. In this project, I created 3D map of the environment from turtlebot robot. I used RBPF localization with occupancy grids to generate 3D Octomaps. The accuracy of this was limited to non-cluttered envirnonments like hallways. As can be seen from the figure.

			<h3>3. Iterative Closest Point Matching using PCL </h3>
	        <p>ICP is one of the common algorithms used to register 2 pointclouds. This outputs a transformation of second cloud wrt first. Often this is used to calculate visual odometry in Visual-slam. <a href="https://github.com/ResByte/3D-mapping/tree/master/Pose_Graph/ICP-Test">Here</a> is an implementation using PCL in ROS.</p>

	        <p>
	        While ubuntu is very good environment for development, it can also be tweaked around for user satisfaction. If you are not interested in Unity and other Gnome desktop managers, this is for you. i3wm is one of the lighweight windows manager and can be tweaked around a lot. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1I63wGcvU4">This</a> is one of the simplest tutorial to get the feel of what I am saying.
